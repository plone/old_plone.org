# Information about the Makefile

How to use the pip, mxdev, cookiecutter-zope-instance and make based install.

## Usage

On the commandline, execute the ``make`` command.
Without any options, make will run all steps.

```bash
make run
```

All options are printed with

```bash
make help
```

```text
clean       remove instance configuration (keeps data)
help        This help message
install     pip install all dependencies and scripts
instance    create configuration for an zope (plone) instance
prepare     prepare soures and dependencies
run         run Plone
```

Order for ``make run`` is: *prepare*, *install*, *instance*, *run*.

The Makefile is built to detect changes.
At the first ``make run`` all steps are excuted.
Subsequent calls are only starting the applicaton server in the *run* step.
If one of the input file is changed, steps needed to take those changes into effect are executed again.

## Files

Initially the files below were generated by `plone-kickstarter`.
They are meant to be modified for your needs.

They aim to ease development and deployment of *Plone 6+*

`constraints.txt`
    Version pins for your project, used by *pip*.
`INSTALL.md`
    (this file)
`instance.yaml`
    Zope/Plone application server configuration. Used by *cookiecutter-zope-instance*
`Makefile`
    The configuration for *make*
`requirement.txt`
    The core requirements.
`sources.ini`
    *mxdev* is used to develop with sources from VCS like Git.
    If you need sources from git, add them here.
